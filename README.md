# MyExpenses-PBI-dashboard
A mobile-optimized Power BI dashboard for all Finance staff to track approved and unapproved expenses via mobile devices.

## Overview
This tool aims to empower business leaders by providing the simplest possible tool to:
- Offering real-time insights into both approved and unapproved/pending corporate card expenses and reimbursements.
- Assessing whether staffs who hold financial authority within the hierarchy are consistently and diligently approving expenditures.

## Key features
- Toggle between approved and unapproved expenses – users can easily switch views between approved and unapproved expenses.
- Detailed transaction view – gain insights into individual transactions by clicking on staff name or amount, followed by the "View Details" button. It provides information about daily expenditures, including merchant, category, status, comments, etc. If a staff has multiple transactions on a single day, it will display each transaction separately.
- Search and filter capabilities – locate specific submitter names and apply filters based on staff members who approved the transactions or are delegated to approve, status, expense type, and date.
- Query the transactions with submitter directly – in the "Something not right?" section on the detailed page, a single click on the email icon will draft an email for the user with relevant information populated automatically.

## Row-level Security
Two roles, Full Access and Limited Access, have been established. The Limited Access role determines user visibility on transactions based on their email logins, restricting access accordingly.

## Project Access 
This project was developed during my time working with the Finance Division at La Trobe University. Due to data privacy and internal policy restrictions, I am unable to share the live dashboard or provide access to the working environment. However, to give viewers an overview of the outcomes, I have exported the dashboard in PDF format for demonstration purposes only.
